# Defense-Against-Adversarial-Patch-Attacks-using-Generative-Neural-Architecture
This project aims to develop a defense strategy to mitigate adversarial patches in image classification systems. Inspired by the research "Anomaly Unveiled: Securing Image Classification against Adversarial Patch Attacks" by Nandish Chattopadhyay et al., the solution utilizes a Generative Neural Architecture (GNA)
